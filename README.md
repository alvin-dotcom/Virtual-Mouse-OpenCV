# Virtual Mouse: Control Your System with Hand Gestures

Virtual Mouse is an innovative project that allows you to control your computer's mouse using **hand gestures**. Built with **OpenCV**, this application leverages computer vision techniques to detect and track hand movements, translating them into mouse actions like cursor movement, clicks, and scrolling. Say goodbye to traditional mice and embrace the future of gesture-based control!

## Usage üñêÔ∏è

1. **Cursor Movement**:
   - Move your hand to control the cursor on the screen.

2. **Left Click**:
   - Perform a specific gesture (e.g., pinch thumb and index finger) to simulate a left click.

3. **Right Click**:
